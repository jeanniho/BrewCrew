# brew_crew

This Flutter Dart application can be used in an office, for example, to make it easier for workers to request beerages from the cafeteria or 
anyone that happening to be going to the cafeteria. It uses Firebase as it's database. It is worth mentioning that after checking it now there seem to be some minor errors with the application such as getting a user's initials but that could and will be solved out easily.
